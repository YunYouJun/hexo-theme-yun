## Self-checking Common Problem Solution

Check if the file or warehouse name is right.

Check if the `url` under `_config.yml` in the `Hexo` working directory is set correctly. (This part is automatically generated when Hexo is initialized)

```yaml
# If your site is put in a subdirectory
# set url as 'https://yoursite.com/child' and root as '/child/'
url: https://www.yunyoujun.cn
root: /
```

Check whether the theme configurations are done in the `_config.yun.yml` file and has been saved.
Check whether the following steps have been performed:

- `hexo clean`: clear the local cache
- `hexo g`: generate a new static file
- `hexo s`: local viewing effect (if normal, use `hexo d` to redeploy)

Check whether the local browser cache have been forcibly refreshed (Windows: `Ctrl + F5`, Mac: `Shift + Cmd + R`).

Check if it is the latest version.

If you still have problems, you can push your project code as a Hexo branch to GitHub.

## `hexo server` :The article only renders part of the content <Badge text="dev"/>

In the process of developing the theme, I found that only a part of a long article can be rendered, and the second half cannot be displayed normally.
At first, I thought it was a problem of `hexo-renderer-pug`. After a day of tossing around, I finally discovered that it seemed to be a problem of `hexo-browsersync` during development.

### Temporary Solution

Set the following in the root directory of `_config.yml`

```yaml
server:
  compress: true
```
