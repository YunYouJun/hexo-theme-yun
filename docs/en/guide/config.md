# Theme Configuration

## Configuration File

Convention > Configuration

::: danger
Please define the configuration you need in `_config.yun.yml`, the rest will automatically use the default configuration.

Unless otherwise specified, they are configured by default in the `_config.yun.yml` file.

It is best not to modify any of the theme's files unless you have certain development capabilities, or else the theme can not be upgraded afterward.
:::

## Language

The default language is Chinese `zh-CN`.

> The language of the site needs to be set in `_config.yml` under the Hexo directory.

```yaml
language: en
```

### Customized Language

Create a new `source/_data/language.yml` in the Hexo working directory. (If the `source/_data` directory does not exist, please create a new one.)

With the convention greater than the configuration, you only need to customize the paragraph or words you want to override in `language.yml` , and the rest will be automatically merged with the theme's default configuration. (This is also more convenient for future upgrades)

Here follows a configuration example,

```yaml
en: # the language need to be overridden
  menu:
    home: My Index

ja: # the language need to be overridden
  menu:
    home: マイインデックス

zh-CN: # the language need to be overridden
  menu:
    home: 我的主页
```

If english is the only used language, all items can be erased other than `en`.

## Theme Color

The main color of the custom theme.

- `bg`: background color (choose a color closer to the main color of your background image in order to make it more coordinated)

> [color-dust](https://www.yunyoujun.cn/color-dust) I wrote a small tool that can analyze the color in pictures.

```yaml
colors:
  primary: '#6200ee'
  # bg: "# F5F5F5"
  selection_bg: '#8e71c1' # background color when selecting text
  # Starting and ending colors of the tags
  # tag_start_color:
  # tag_end_color:
```

### Tags

You can specify the color for your label, the default color is `#333`.

```yaml
tags:
  Vue: '#4fc08d'
  Hexo: '#0E834D'
  CSS: '#5298d1'
  Node.js: '#026E00'
  Git: '#F14E32'
  React: '#61dafb'
  Python: '#3776ab'
  PHP: '#8892BF'
  VS Code: '#0066B8'
  JavaScript: '#F4DF4F'
  TypeScript: '#317AC6'
  Laravel: '#F4645F'
```

### Categories

You can specify the color for your category, the default color is `#333`.

```yaml
categories:
  Notes: dimgray
```

## Head Resources

If you have resources that you want to load, please add them to the `head`.

Follow the example below to customize the `css` and `js` resources you want to add.

JavaScript resource type description:

- `base`: must be loaded and executed in advance.
- `async`: Asynchronous loading, executed immediately after loading.
- `defer`: load the resource asynchronously, but execute it last.

```yaml
head:
  css:
    example: //example.min.css
  js:
    base:
      - xxx
    async:
    defer:
```

::: tip

If you want to custom css，please set `_config.yun.yml`:

```yaml
head:
  css:
    custom: /css/custom.css
```

file is `source/css/custom.css` (Just new it yourself!)

Then write you custom css.

```css
.char {
  background-color: transparent;
}
```

:::

### favicon

Set the website icon (make sure your `favicon.ico` file is placed under the `source` folder), set as follows:

```yaml
favicon: /favicon.ico
```

> When your picture is in `png` format, please make sure its size is `16*16`, `32*32`, `64*64`, `128*128`, `256*256`, etc. .

Yun Logo can use the corresponding opposite colors according to the light and dark theme of the browser.

For example, the bright browser LOGO has a black stroke, and the dark browser LOGO has a white stroke.

Your icon must be an `svg` file, and add a corresponding style to it.

> You can refer to my LOGO SVG code. [yun.svg](https://github.com/YunYouJun/hexo-theme-yun/blob/dev/source/yun.svg)

For Example:

```html
<svg id="yun-logo">
  <style>
    #yun-logo {
      stroke: black;
    }

    @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
      #yun-logo {
        stroke: white;
      }
    }
  </style>
</svg>
```

## CDN

Content Delivery Network unifies the loading of network resources; it is conducive to improving the speed of web page loading.

[jsDelivr – Open Source CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com) is a free and open-source CDN, with good domestic speed performance, and a unified CDN source which is also conducive to loading speed.
Therefore, this theme's CDN defaults to jsDelivr and uses `dns-prefetch` to pre-parse jsDelivr.

You can also obtain the CDN you want according to the naming rules, and introduce it in the `head`:

- GitHub CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file`
- npm: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/package@version/file`

`cdn` is the CDN resource currently introduced by the theme by default, and its structure is similar to `head`.

```yaml
cdn:
  pre: ''
  css:
  js:
    base:
      - xxx
    async:
      # Icon resources introduced by default, use iconfont
      iconfont: //at.alicdn.com/t/font_1140697_dxory92pb0h.js
    defer:
```

- `pre`: empty by default, your loading resource prefix. For example, if you want to use `jsdelivr` to accelerate the static resources of the whole station, you can set it in `_config.yun.yml` like this.

> Replace `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/` with your GitHub username and repository name (you can also add the current branch, such as `@master`).
> `@latest` is to use the latest version (but it will still be cached, **and it will take 12 hours to update**, if you need to force a refresh, please refer to [Purge Cache](https://github.com/jsdelivr/sdelivr#purge-cache)
> In addition, please make sure that your avatar image link uses `/images/xxx.jpg` instead of `https://xxx/xxx.jpg`.

```yaml
cdn:
  pre: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YunYouJun/yunyoujun.github.io@latest
```

::: tip
If you customize the resources used by the theme and want to preview and debug locally more conveniently,

you can add `"dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development && hexo s"` in the `scripts` field of `package.json` in the Hexo working directory.

And `npm install cross-env`. See [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env).

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development &&hexo s"
  }
}
```

And start it through `npm run dev`; it is now in development mode.`cdn.pre` is not used by default.
:::

### Overwrite Icon Font

```yaml
cdn:
  js:
    async:
      iconfont: your iconfont custom resource
```

### Preloading

Use `preload`, `prefetch`, `preconnect`, `dns-prefetch` to optimize the speed of webpage recording.

- `preload`: resources that will be used after this page
- `prefetch`: resources that may be used after jump to the page
- `dns-prefetch`: resolve the DNS address of the domain name that will be used
- `preconnect`: establish a link with the specified domain name in advance; it has more TCP connections than`dns-prefetch`

`preload` and `prefetch` are only used to load local resources (and generally use by default). Do not use resources with a protocol header (`http://`).

CDN can be added at `head`.

> [\<link\> : External resource link element-MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)

```yaml
preload:
  style:
    - /css/hexo-theme-yun.css
  script:
    - /js/hexo-theme-yun.js

prefetch:
  script:
    - /js/sidebar.js

dns_prefetch:
  - https://cos.yunyoujun.cn

# do more (TCP handshake ...) than dns-fetch
preconnect:
  - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net
```

## Icon Library

This theme uses some of Remix Icon's icons by default and loads through cdn generated by iconfont.

> The default icon list refer to [default icons](/en/about/icon.html)

If you want to use other icons, the following icons are recommended.

- Method 1: Most recommended, all use custom `iconfont` icon set. (Fast speed, but need to be configured by yourself)
- Method 2: Freely import the css style file of the font icon in [head](#head-head resource), and directly input the corresponding `class` name. (Often all icon resources are introduced. Although it is convenient to introduce them at once, many icons are not practical.)

::: tip
You can go to [iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/) to customize a set of icons and cover the icon resources introduced by [CDN] (# CDN).
If you just want to add a few extra icons, you'd better introduce it at [head](# head-header resource) instead of directly overwriting it.
:::

Here are some ways to use basic icons.

This theme is adapted to the use of the following icons.

### [iconfont](https://www.iconfont.cn/)

Under Alibaba, you can customize your own icon set. Domestic speed is decent in China. (recommend)

[Instructions](https://www.iconfont.cn/help/detail?helptype=code)

Multi-color icons need to be quoted in the `symbol` of the article.

Then set as follow in `_config.yun.yml`.

```yaml
head:
  js:
    async:
      # Here is the icon link you got from iconfont.
      iconfont: //at.alicdn.com/t/font_1140697_dxory92pb0h.js
```

### [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/)

- GitHub: <https://github.com/Remix-Design/remixicon>
- CDN: <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon/fonts/remixicon.css>

Simple, elegant and open source.

### [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com)

- GitHub: [ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons)
- CDN CSS: <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ionicons/dist/css/ionicons.min.css>
- CDN JS: <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ionicons/dist/ionicons.js>

There is no trademark icon, you can use Web Component and load it on demand.

#### Loading Method 1: Web Component

It can automatically switch the suitable style `Material/ iOS` according to the `Android/iOS` platform.

This theme has adapted the way the `ion-icon` tag is introduced, just configure it as follows.

```yaml
head:
  js:
    async: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ionicons/dist/ionicons.js
```

```yaml
icon: ion-icon heart
```

#### Loading Method 2: CSS Introduction

```yaml
head:
  css:
    ionicons: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ionicons/dist/css/ionicons.min.css
```

```yaml
icon: icon ion-md-heart
```

### [Material Design icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/)

- GitHub: [material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)
- [Material Design icons](https://material.io/tools/icons)

Uniform style, no trademark icon. Produced by Google, due to domestic policies, loading may not be stable if using in China.

The theme has also been adapted.

::: tip

Why do we need to adapt?

Original way of use

`face` is the internal content of `<i></i>`, not `class`.

```html
<i class="material-icons">face</i>
```

:::

引入对应 CDN 资源：

```yaml
head:
  css:
    material: https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons
```

```yaml
icon: material-icons face
```

### Other Icons

Similar to the use of the above icons fill in the corresponding icon `class` in the icon-related configuration.

Such as [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

> GitHub: [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)

Introduce CSS：

```yaml
head:
  css:
    fontawesome: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css
```

Write class name:

```yaml
icon: fas fa-home
```

> In fact, it is not recommended to introduce all `font-awesome`, because it is really big.

## Social Icons

The following social icons are provided by default. You can obtain more icons by introducing custom icon resources in [head](#head-head resource)
For better display, my default link will be displayed.

- `name`: link name
- `link`: link
- `icon`: Icon Class
- `color`: Icon color (If the icon you introduced supports SVG custom colors in advance) The current default color adopts the official icon brand color.

```yaml
social:
  - name: RSS
    # set rss in your root config
    # https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed
    link: atom.xml # config.feed.path
    icon: ri:rss-line
    color: orange
  - name: GitHub
    link: https://github.com/YunYouJun
    icon: ri:github-line
    color: '# 181717'
  - name: E-Mail
    link: mailto:me@yunyoujun.cn
    icon: ri:mail-line
    color: '# 8E71C1'

    color: '#1da1f2'
  - name: Telegram
    link: https://t.me/YunYouJun
    icon: ri:telegram-line
    color: '#0088CC'
  - name: Telegram Channel
    link: https://t.me/elpsycn
    icon: ri:telegram-fill
    color: '#0088CC'
```

You only need to set `social` in `_config.yun.yml` to overwrite it (at this time you can only display your mailbox icon and no other icons):

```yaml
social:
  - name: E-Mail
    link: mailto:your email
    icon: ri:mail-line
    color: '#8E71C1'
```

If you don't want to put any links, just set the following in `_config.yun.yml`:

```yaml
social:
```

## Home

### Slogan Animation

The verticallly staggered text effect on the homepage is enabled by default.

You can visit <https://yunyoujun.cn> to see the effect. (Each refresh will display random font size)

> This is the earliest function implemented during the development of this theme. During the period, it was refactored several times due to compatibility issues of browsers such as Safari, and the loading speed was also improved.
> It was a function that went through three dynasties, lol.

- `enable`: whether to enable -`title`: set text content
- `title`: Text content
- `border`: display the left and right border of char
- `cloud`: Display float cloud
  - `enable`: enable it
  - `color`: custom cloud color
- `go_down`: go down arrow button (click it to go down)

```yaml
banner:
  enable: true
  title: 云游君的小站
  border: true
  cloud:
    enable: true
    color: white
  go_down:
    enable: true
    icon: ri:arrow-down-s-line
```

You can customize the character segmentation in the form of an array, for example:

```yaml
banner:
  title:
    - Yun
    - You
    - Jun
    - Blog
```

### Announcement

You can configure the announcement as follows.
It will be displayed at the top of all article cards, below the tagline.

```yaml
notice:
  enable: true
  content: Thanks for playing my game.
```

## UI

### Light and Dark Mode

- `light`: always light mode without dark style assets
- `dark`: always dark mode
- `auto`: switch mode by system mode, display toggle button in sidebar
- `time`: switch light and dark mode by time, `07:00-19:00` is light mode, and the remaining time is dark mode

> Black icon will be white in dark mode.

You can set isolate background for dark mode, please see corresponding config.

```yaml
# light | dark | auto | time
mode: auto
```

### Font

You can set your font family and font-weight.

:::tip

If you use non-system-built fonts, you also need to go to [head](#head-头资源) to import them.

For example, the “Noto Serif SC” font with a weight of 900 is introduced.

> In order to ensure that this theme is light enough, no fonts are introduced by default, and the default fonts that come with the system are used. You can decide whether to introduce it.

```yaml
head:
  css:
    fonts: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif+SC:wght@900&display=swap
```

:::

The fonts of this theme are mainly divided into the following three categories.

> You can only cover the font family you want to cover.

- `Serif`: The bolder form is emphasized, and is usually used in homepage banners, Say, site and article titles (and the names of works on pages such as links and girls).
- `Sans Serif`: Usually normal text content. (If your font is bold, it may be that you installed the `PingFang SC` font on the Windows system, but did not install the corresponding font weight.)
- `monospace`: The characters all have the same width and are usually used where the same width is required for alignment (such as dates, serial numbers).

Set `font.cdn.enable` to `false` to use all system default fonts to achieve the best access speed. (When enabled by default, use `media="none" onload="this.media='all'"` to achieve css style asynchronous loading.)

```yaml
font:
  cdn:
    enable: true
    lib:
      - https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Serif+SC:wght@900&display=swap
  serif:
    family: '''Songti SC'', ''Noto Serif SC'', STZhongsong, STKaiti, KaiTi, Roboto, serif'
    weight: 900
  sans_serif:
    family: '''PingFang SC'', ''Microsoft YaHei'', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif'
    weight: 400
  monospace:
    family: '''Source Code Pro'', ''Courier New'', Courier, Consolas, Monaco, monospace'
```

### Background

- `opacity`: background transparency

::: tip
Note that the background blur is now disabled by default. It is also recommended that users use image processing tools to blur images for the background.

> You can also use some online image blur tools directly. For example, [Gaussian Blur](https://www.anooc.com/ts/gs) (This is only the first one I found on Google, you can find your favorite tool to process it.)

This also eliminates the white borders produced during the application of `blur` filter to color pictures.
At the same time, it can also reduce the background of the image and improve the loading and rendering speed.
:::

- `dark`: the image url for dark mode

```yaml
bg_image:
  enable: true
  url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YunYouJun/cdn/img/bg/stars-timing-0-blur-30px.jpg
  # dark:
  # blur: 30px # Set the blurry degree of background
  opacity: 0.8
```

> If you want to use a custom image background, just put it in the `source/images` folder and use `/images/xxx.jpg` to import it.
>
> Note: If you use a subdirectory to place your blog, such as `xxx.github.io/blog/`, your picture link needs to be set to `/blog/xxx`, or you can directly use the image hosting.

#### Search Background

- `modal` If you enable `modal`, the search background will be the blurred underlying content, and the background image will no longer be used.
- `placeholder`: search box prompt text (if not set, the corresponding text will be automatically selected according to Hexo language configuration)
- `dark_bg_image`: background for dark mode

```yaml
search:
  modal: true
  bg_image: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/YunYouJun/cdn/img/bg/stars-timing-2.jpg
  dark_bg_image: xxx
  # placeholder:
```

> For more search settings, please refer to [Search-Third Party Support](/guide/third-party-support.html#search)

---
```

The bilibili icon will appear in front of the article title. Clicking on the title will jump to the corresponding link.

Currently, the following types are supported by default (Bilibili, Douban, GitHub, NetEase Cloud Music, WeChat Official Account, Weibo, Yuque, Twitter, Zhihu, and Outer Links):

```yaml
types:
  link:
    color: blue
    icon: ri:external-link-line
  bilibili:
    color: '#FF8EB3'
    icon: ri:bilibili-line
  douban:
    color: '#007722'
    icon: ri:douban-line
  github:
    color: black
    icon: ri:github-line
  netease-cloud-music:
    color: '#C10D0C'
    icon: ri:netease-cloud-music-line
  notion:
    color: black
    icon: ri:notion
  twitter:
    color: '#1da1f2'
    icon: ri:twitter-line
  wechat:
    color: '#1AAD19'
    icon: ri:wechat-2-line
  weibo:
    color: '#E6162D'
    icon: ri:weibo-line
  yuque:
    color: '#25b864'
    icon: ant-design:yuque-outlined
  zhihu:
    color: '#0084FF'
    icon: ri:zhihu-line
```

You can also set your icon and color for different links in `_config.yun.yml`.

```yaml
types:
  google:
    color: xxx
    icon: xxx
```

When the `type` you specified does not exist in the default nor is customized, the blue extra link icon will be used by default.

If you want to display information on your external link card, you can write it before `<!-- more -->`, it will be displayed as a summary.

e.g.:

```md
---
title: hexo-theme-yun
type: github
url: https://github.com/YunYouJun/hexo-theme-yun
---

Hexo theme Yun

<!-- more -->
```

#### Hide

You can add a `hide` attribute at the head of the article to temporarily hide an article.

- `hide`:
  - `index`: only hide in index, display in archives
  - `true`: not display in index and archives, but rendered. You can visit the link to view.

> What? Do you want to not render or display at all? Then why don't you put it in the `_drafts` folder, or simply not submit this article.

```md
---
title: xxx
hide: true
# hide: index
sitemap: false
indexing: false
---
```

::: tip

If you use sitemap, it will display in `sitemap.xml`. You need set `sitemap: false` in front matter to exclude it.

> [excluding-posts | hexo-generator-sitemap](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-sitemap#excluding-posts)

If you use local-search, it will show in `search.xml`. You need set `indexing: false` in front matter to exclude it.

> [exclude-indexing | hexo-generator-search](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-generator-search#exclude-indexing)

:::

### Information

- `item_text`: whether to display text (for example: posted on, updated on. If disabled, it will only display icon and time)
- `created_at`: whether to show the creation time
- `updated_at`: whether to show updated time
- `categories`: whether to display categories
- `tags`: whether to display tags

```yaml
post_meta:
  item_text: false
  created_at: true
  updated_at: true
  categories: true
  tags: true
```

### Table of Contents

As long as you follow [Markdown syntax](https://segmentfault.com/markdown), the directory will be automatically generated!

::: tip

An HTML page with good SEO has and should have only one `h1` as the first level heading.
This theme uses the `title` you set as the first-level title by default.
In the content of the following article, you should only start using the secondary heading.

```md
---
title: Level 1 Heading
---

## Level 2 Heading
```

:::

> No one will disable this feature, lol

When you turn on the display number and switch to the directory, click the directory button again to switch the hidden number.

- `list_number`:Displays list number
- `max_depth`: Maximum heading depth of generated toc
- `min_depth`: Minimum heading depth of generated toc
- `placeholder`: Display Text when toc is empty.
- `collapse`: Whether to collapse the directory (folded by default, that is, the secondary directory is hidden, and only expanded when it is rolled to the relevant position)

```yaml
toc:
  list_number: true
  max_depth: 6
  min_depth: 1
  placeholder: Sorry, it is empty.
  collapse: false
```

### Edit Link

If enabled, an edit icon will be displayed next to the article page title.
Click to jump to the editing page.

- `url`: the address of the article (you can refer to the default link when setting your warehouse jump link)

If I use `GitHub` as the hosting warehouse for the blog, the warehouse name is `yunyoujun.github.io`, under the `hexo` branch, in the `source` folder,
where my link will be <https://github.com/YunYouJun/yunyoujun.github.io/tree/hexo/source/>.

```yaml
post_edit:
  enable: true
  url: https://github.com/YunYouJun/yunyoujun.github.io/tree/hexo/source/
```

### Code Highlighting

Set code highlight

Due to performance and positioning issues, and [Hexo 5.0](https://blog.skk.moe/post/hexo-5/) has native support for prism, this topic is more recommended to use [prismjs](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) instead of `highlight.js`.

> Please upgrade hexo to 5.0.0. `npm install hexo@latest`

PrismJS is a lightweight code highlighting library. Compared with highlight.js, prismjs can be executed in the Node.js environment (that is, code highlighting can be performed when Hexo generates a page).

We can quickly switch themes through the CDN. This theme also supports setting different code highlight themes for light and dark modes.

> Languages ​​currently supported by Prism: <https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages>

Configure in `_config.yml` in the working directory of Hexo (must be upgraded to version 5.0 or higher):

```yaml
# disable highlight
highlight:
  enable: false
# enable prism
prismjs:
  enable: true
  preprocess: true
  line_number: false
  tab_replace: ''
```

In `_config.yun.yml`:

- `copy_btn`: enable copy button in codeblock

> Since v1.8.3, code block will auto toggle light/dark mode.

```yaml
codeblock:
  copy_btn: true
```

> It is recommended to close the line number, [here](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/line-numbers.html) is the where the author wrote why highlight does not support line numbers.
> After hexo-prism-plugin enables the line number, there will be some inconsistencies in the theme style.
> It doesn't matter if the line number exists. When it is removed, some space can be saved. For example, some codes that originally required scroll bars can be completely displayed after being removed.

```yaml

- `comment`: show what you want to say under the reward button
- `url`: your reward link (when you enable the reward link, it will automatically jump to your external link instead of expanding the QR code)

### QR Code for Reward

QQ, WeChat, and Alipay reward icons are supported by default, and `color` is a custom icon color.

- `name`: donating method
- `path`: image path

You can override it in `_config.yun.yml`.

```yaml

For example, sometimes it can use other service providers to host pages.

```yaml
footer:
custom_text: Hosted by <a href="https://pages.coding.me" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Coding Pages </a>
```

## Say

Randomly display a sentence on the homepage of the website ~~eighth-grade syndrome. (By default, [hitokoto](https://hitokoto.cn/) is used as the API)

- `enable`: whether to enable hitokoto
- `api`: Remote JSON API
- `src`: the called js file, it is best not to modify it (you can also write it yourself according to its structure to load the desired JSON format.)
- `hitokoto.enable`: Whether to enable [hitokoto](https://hitokoto.cn/), when you enable hitokoto, it will override `say.api` by default
- `hitokoto.api`: You can refer to [Statement Interface ｜ hitokoto](https://developer.hitokoto.cn/sentence/) to use the koto API according to your thoughts

```yaml
say:
  enable: true
  api: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ElpsyCN/say@gh-pages/sentences.json
  # https://developer.hitokoto.cn/sentence/
  hitokoto:
    enable: true
    api: https://v1.hitokoto.cn
```

When you close hitokoto, the data at `say.api` will be used by default.

> [say.elpsy.cn](https://say.elpsy.cn) is where I have stored my eighthgrade syndrome hitokoto collections. = =, automatically export JSON for pulling.

### Customize

You can also use custom sentences.

Create a new `data/sentences.json` under the `source` folder in the root directory. (Note that `data` is not `_data`, or you can also create another folder.)

The format is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "content": "Hello, World!",
    "author": "Brian Kernighan",
    "from": "The C Programming Language"
  },
  {
    "content": "Yeah, what I love is neither the stars nor the galaxy.",
    "author": "YunYouJun",
    "from": "yunyoujun.cn"
  },
  {
    "content": "Vague thunder, hazy sky, but hope the wind and rain will keep you here",
    "from": "Wan Ye Ji · 雷神短歌"
  }
]
```

Then set `say.api` to `/data/sentences.json`, and close it.

i.e.:

```yaml
say:
  enable: true
  api: /data/sentences.json
  hitokoto:
    enable: false
```

## Special

### Mourn

On the designated day of the year, the gray mourning mode is enabled.

- `enable`: Disabled by default.

> On April 4, the nation mourned.
> In order to express the deep condolences of the people of all ethnic groups in the country in the fight against the Coronavirus Pandemic, at the expense of martyrs and deceased compatriots, the State Council issued an announcement and decided to hold a national mourning event on April 4, 2020.

```yaml
mourn:
  enable: true
  days: -"4-4"
```

## Custom Style

Compared with the introduction of `head`, you can write a `stylus` file here, use the existing variables of the theme, and compile it into `hexo-theme-yun.css`.

> Create a new `source/_data/style` folder, and then create a new `xxx.styl` to start writing your custom style.

For example, import all the `.styl` files under your `source/_data/style` in the following way.

```yaml
custom:
  style: source/_data/style/*
```

## Vendors

Vendors means suppliers, vending machines.

The third-party CDN link used will be set here.
More information can be found at [`_vendors.yml`](<https://github.com/YunYouJun/hexo-theme-yun/blob/dev/packages/hexo>- theme-yun/_vendors.yml).

For example, it can be overridden in `_config.yun.yml` in the following ways:

> - `host`: CDN start link, since `cdn.jsdelivr.net` has been polluted in China, it is recommended to use `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/` instead.

````yaml
vendors:
  # ends with '/'
  host: 'https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/'
  waline:
    css: '@waline/client@v2/dist/waline.css'
````
